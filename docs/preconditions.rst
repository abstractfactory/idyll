Pre-conditions
==============

This guide will walk you through the ideal setup for use with Pipi. 

The goal is to minimise/remove as many pre-conditions (PCs) as possible, but for the time being anything not conforming to the following will require bespoke integration.

- PC1: You should be running either Windows 7 or 8.1, 64-bit with at least 2GB of disk space available.
- PC2: Production should be centered around Maya and Nuke. 
- PC3: For production tracking you should be using Asana_.
- PC4: Your crew should consist of around 1-10 members with >= 1 technical artist.
- PC5: Production should be full CG and centered around Character-Animation.
